            "\tIn India, a certain amount of crop (transgenic) biotechnology is being put to use. Major efforts are being undertaken to make cotton pest-resistant. Most people would be aware of the spate of suicides by cotton farmers recently. Let us hope there will be scientific and technological breakthroughs in pest resistant transgenic cotton seeds. Till we achieve success in this on a commercial scale we cannot be sure that we will have enough supplies to plan large-scale operations. No doubt, such researches should be encouraged, but we should look at other fronts too. It is necessary for research on crop biotechnology in India to be focused on our important crops, especially those related to food security. \n\tWe have to bear in mind that the application of biotechnology may not have any major impact on food security in India in the next five years, though crops of industrial value and vegetables may benefit to some extent. Therefore, we will still need to depend upon conventional agricultural technologies even while we target biotechnology of future oriented applications. Internationally, no major breakthrough in improvement of wheat strains has occurred lately. Hybrid rice is more productive. China had a few major initial successes in increasing the yield through large-scale use of hybrid rice. India has begun use of hybrid rice recently and there are plans to increase it. But it may be noted that in recent years there has been no further improvement in Chinese production of rice. Still, hybrid rice will play an important role in India, as we are yet to introduce it on a large scale. \n\tThere are a number of improvements in agricultural implements, machinery, plastics, water technologies, agro-chemicals and fertilizers which are possible and are well within the country's reach. There is an urgent need to conserve water in a number of ways; ranging from water harvesting to drip irrigation. There are a number of good examples in India of water harvesting though these are in isolated pockets.",
            "\tDeliberative democracy demands a reflexive (or reflection driven) reordering of preferences in a non coercive manner. The authenticity of democracy requires in addition that these reflective preferences, influence collective outcomes and action, and so long the state is the main (though far from exclusive) locus of collective decisions, it requires discursive mechanisms for transmission of public opinion to state. A deliberative or more properly a discursive democracy, in order that it can accommodate several competing versions of democracies such as the liberal, the minimal, the difference, etc., must also accommodate rhetoric, narratives, and empathy along with reasoning. A rationality and a reasoning that does not accommodate values is meaningless. However, it is also argued that individual rationality cannot be realised if values are embedded in the decision procedures, in other words, realisation of values could be made possible only when individuals behave non-rationally. Further if values having been abandoned at the individual level are accorded a place only collectively, the same must lead to either epistemological inconsistency or abandonment of autonomy of individual evaluations\". A talk or a rhetoric, otherwise, is strategic and is employed with the intention of signaling certain information. Such a talk can be therefore deceptive and coercive. The illocutionary force and the normative trappings of a Foucauldian discourse while allowing identification with a community and differences with the others, do simultaneously pose through coercion a threat to an utterance as such. If democracy cannot ensure utterance as freedom and if the illocutionary forces in a discursive democracy disciplines the thought and the talk, then how such a democracy could indeed be called authentic! \n\tMost human actions and discourses are actuated by a deeper or primordial ante-deliberation Desire (let us use a capital 'D'). Speaking as such is out of such a Desire (one might use volition or passion).",

The ones who sit at the four corners face the Centre while those who sit in the middle of the sides face outside. P who faces the centre sits third to the right of V. T, who faces the centre, is not an immediate neighbor of V. Only one person sits between V and W. S sits second to the right of Q. Q faces the centre. R is not an immediate neighbor of P.

A will go to Hyderabad by Ritz. A's sister D wants to travel in Swift.

            "\t\"Thanks, Nature.\" Two little words marked the end of the speech of Fabiola Gianotti, the spokesperson of the ATLAS experiment, indicating the collective sigh of relief at what is believed to be the beginning of the end of the longest, and most expensive, search in the history of science. \n\tThe discovery of the Higgs particle will lead to a new understanding of the origin of matter in the Universe, which occurred in the smallest fraction of a second after its creation 13.4 billion years ago. Indeed, it is the key to understanding the existence of diversity and life in the Universe. \n\tPhysicists believe that the Higgs particle has been spotted at the world's largest and most expensive laboratory- 27 km in circumference, 100 m below ground, straddling the border of France and Switzerland. The Large Hadron Collider, a multi-billion-dollar array of machines, is run by a pan-European organization called CERN in Geneva. This is where, among other things, the World Wide Web was invented. Now it is the scene of another ground-breaking event. The world has been waiting for over 40 years since professor Peter Higgs, currently at the University of Edinburgh, UK, predicted the existence of Higgs particle. In recent years, \"Higgs Rumors\" has been one of the most popular hash tags on Twitter. \n\tAccording to the standard theory, at the moment of the creation of the Universe, all particles were massless, and they all travelled at the speed of light. Atrillionth of a second after the birth of the Universe, an all-pervading invisible field switched on, that caused particles to acquire mass. This is known as the \"Higgs field\", and its only visible manifestation is the Higgs boson. \n\tWhen I run on a track, I am at my fastest, but if I try to fun on sand, or in water, I won't be able to get up to the same speed, even though I might exert the same energy. If a bunch of particles is given the same amount of energy, the more massive particles travel sluggishly, and the lighter particles travel at higher speeds.",

However, a universally accepted formula for measurement of 1C has still not been created, countries like India, China and Japan known for knowledge assets, are still struggling to implement the knowledge management practices. There is a need to identify the process for creation of 1C in K-economy. \n\tThe human capital of a nation depends on the practices and culture followed by the citizens of that nation. For creation of human capital, the roles of ethics and value systems cannot be ignored. More perseverance, hard work, knowledge sharing culture, and knowledge currency distribution are required. The GATT and WTO through Intellectual Property Rights Act also support the 1C creation practices. \n\tCustomer capital creation is facing a global challenge. Managing relationship with customers is the key issue now-a-days. These practices believe in customer delight rather than customer satisfaction. The Business Process Outsourcing and human re-engineering era will give quality products and services to the customers, if redesigning of customer equity is taken care of by the organizations. The cash-cow companies pursue the organisational goal of earning satisfactory to 45 per cent through quality circles, workers participation in management, job rotation etc. Sustained retention of old customers and attraction of new ones, present an immense, challenge to the organisation in the K-economy. \n\tThe infrastructure capital creation depends totally on the organisation, the organisational culture and organisational climate. 500 companies are able to sustain culture.",
            "\tBritain feels and looks very different now from only a week ago. The general election, of May 7, threw up many surprises - the relection of a majority Conservative Government, the scale of the Scottish National Party (SNP) landslide, and Scotland and England pointing in completely opposite political directions. The SNP won 56 of Scotland's 59 constituencies, reducing the dominant Labour Party north of the border from 41 seats at the previous election to a single seat. A whole host of luminaries lost their seats including the Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Douglas Alexander and the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Margaret Curran. How did this happen, when only months ago the SNP lost the independence referendum, and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, considered the whole issue \"settled\"? And what does it mean for the SNP's aim of Scottish independence and the future, if any, of the United Kingdom? \n\tThe mood in Scotland at this time is difficult to fully convey. Scottish public opinion, despite its centre-left credentials and traditions, doesn't do outward celebrations of victory. This isn't the culture of a Milan or Buenos Aires where people take to the streets in their cars tooting and cheering to mark a political event. Allowing for this Scottish reticence, there is a sense of quiet satisfaction in parts of the country. Many people felt that Scottish Labour had become the political establishment - complacent, out of touch, showing little respect for its own professed values - and wanted to punish it. The explanations offered for this range from observations that \"Blair destroyed the Labour Party\" to \"the Iraq war\", from \"I don't know what they stand for anyone\" to \"they are the same as the Tories\" and that \"Labour do not stand up for Scotland, but take their orders from London\". A mixture of public anger and disappointment exists towards Labour in Scotland that has built up over decades. There then followed the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.",
            "\tTop government officials can't resist blaming the woes of the Indian economy - slackening investments, slower growth, a wobbly rupee, among others - on the ongoing turmoil in eurozone economies like Greece. At the risk of sounding like a \"nattering nabob of negativism\", to borrow an expression of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, nothing could be further from the truth. These problems stem from policy uncertainty, if not paralysis; from a government that has abandoned its reform agenda. \n\tThe country has a booming $1.7 - trillion economy that has integrated with the global economy and attracted $247 billion of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) since 2000. It is the world's second faster growing economy, with GDP growth averaging 8.2% per annum over the last six years. But thanks to policy inaction, slower growth due to declining investments has kicked in since last year. FDI inflows in particular have been declining sharply to $32.9 billion in 2010 - 11 when compared to $41.8 billion in 2008 - 09. \n\tNot only have FDI inflows slowed down, outflows due to repatriation of investments have also gone up to $10.7 billion in 2011, according to Nomura Research. The reasons include delays in the approval of big - ticket investment proposals; pursuit of 'environment - sensitive' policies in denying forest clearances for projects in steel and mining; and delays in land acquisition. Investors have also been concerned by the threat of retrospective taxation, especially for offshore Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) . A comparison of actual FDI, vis - a - vis the potential level determined on the basis of macro - economic factors showed that \"actual FDI, which has generally tracked the potential level till 2009 - 10, fell short of its potential by about 25% during 2010 - 11... this large divergence between the actual and the potential was partly on account of rise in policy uncertainty\", according to a recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) study on 'Foreign Direct Investment Flows to India'.",
            "\tThe arrest of the Kashmir separatist leader Masarat Alam Bhat within six weeks of his release from jail shows an early collapse of the 'healing touch' policy adopted by the Jammu and Kashmir government led by the Peoples Democratic Party soon after coming to power. Mr. Alam was a known troublemaker with the potential to instigate violence, and little thought seemed to have gone into the decision to let him walk free from jail after more than four years in detention. At a rally to be addressed by Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani in Srinagar, Mr. Alam was at the head of a group of youths shouting anti-India slogans and waving the Pakistan flag, forcing the government to first place him under house arrest and later take him into custody. That the PDP and its partner in government, the Bharatiya Janata Party, were divided on how to deal with Mr. Alam was evident from the start. Not only did the PDP fail to consult the BJP on the issue, it appears to have underestimated the sinister consequences of releasing Mr. Alam without wresting any kind of assurances from him. If Mr. Alam's release last month embarrassed the BJP, his arrest now is an acceptance of failure by the PDP, which was at pains to stress that while the released person had a history of involvement with stone-pelting he had never wielded a gun. \n\tIf political considerations weighed heavily in the decision to release Mr. Alam, matters of practical policing seemed to have forced the government's hand in ordering his rearrest. Other than giving the hardliners in the Kashmir dispute an opportunity to regroup, the release and rearrest episode appears to have achieved little. The Kashmir issue is not any closer to a solution. Politically, both the PDP and the BJP will be seen as having bungled in this case. In a state torn by violence, flag-waving and sloganeering might seem minor crimes, but the Jammu and Kashmir government cannot be seen as ignoring the anti-national implications of Mr. Alam's waving the Pakistan flag in the Valley.",
            "\tToday, emerging markets account for more than half of world GDP on the basis of purchasing power, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In the 1990s, it was about a third. In the late 1990s, 30% of countries in the developing world managed to increase their output per person faster than America did, thus achieving what is called \"catch-up growth\". That catching up was somewhat lackadaisical : the gap closed at just 1.5% a year. Some of this was due to slower growth in America; most was not. The most impressive growth was in four of the biggest emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs). These economies have grown in different ways and for different reasons. The remarkable growth of emerging markets in general and BRICs in particular transformed the global economy in many ways, some wrenching. \n\tCommodity prices particularly soared and the cost of manufacture and labour sank. A growing and vastly more accessible pool of labour in emerging economies played a part in both wage stagnation and rising income inequality in rich ones. Global poverty rates tumbled. Gaping economic imbalances fuelled an era of financial vulnerability and laid the groundwork for global crisis. The shift towards the emerging economies will continue. But its most tumultuous phase seems to have more or less reached its end. Growth rates have dropped. The nature of their growth is in the process of changing, too, and its new mode will have fewer direct effects on the rest of the world. The likelihood of growth in other emerging economies having an effect in the near future comparable to that of BRICs in the recent past is low. The emerging giants will grow larger, and their ranks will swell but their tread will no longer shake the Earth as once it did. \n\tAfter the 1990s there followed 'convergence with a vengeance'. China's pivot towards liberalization and global markets came at a propitious time in terms of politics, business and technology. Rich economies were feeling relaxed about globalization.",
            "\tTo some extent, it is the nature of the intellect to narrow our vision and give it focus. Tragedy comes in when we forget this limitation and think that the intellect can comprehend things as a whole. The intellect views the world through a slit. When a cat walks by, it observes the eye, then fur, and then the tail, and then it infers that the eye is the cause of the tail, unless of course, the cat was walking backward. If this sounds absurd, some of the theories about biochemistry and behaviour use very similar reasoning. Nachiketa would object, 'Man, why don't you open the door? That's just your black cat Frodo, pacing back and forth'. But instead we usually get caught up in clarifying slit-information, even though without a larger view our conclusions may be entirely wrong. To make matters words, we specialize. I am not against specialization per se but what often happens is that we do not even look through whole slit; we subdivide. My field is the upper part of the tail; yours is the lower. I might even forget about the eye and the fur. My main concern will be my debate with a colleague in Tokyo over whether hair on the tail grows up or down. If anybody asks how the eyes fits in, I refer him to another researcher. After all, what have eyes got to do with geotropic hair growth? \n\tDebates like this cannot be resolved on the slit level. What is required is to open the door; then argument becomes unnecessary. Once the door is opened, even a little, we will not quarrel over whose slit is correct or whether we should confine ourselves to the top of it or the bottom. As long as we see only part of the picture, logic and argumentation can never settle an issue. When the intellect becomes calm and clear, theory gives way to demonstration. It is not beyond our reach to see life whole. We have simply become so attached to this precious slit that we think there is no higher mode of knowing. After a while, we become so used to slits that we put on a special mask with just a hairline crack in front of the eyes.",
            "\tThe news from China in recent weeks has been dire. Violent strikes and protests are reported almost daily. Millions of workers are out of jobs. Economic indicators presage more gloom, with electricity production for industry falling 4% in October, the first time it has declined in a decade. So is China the \"fragile superpower,\" as historian Susan Shirk memorably termed it about to experience the one thing its leaders have feared for years: a so called hard landing of its economy that could spark widespread social unrest ? \n\tHow will China weather the Financial Storm? China's view of the Financial Meltdown: Alarmed But Confident Behind the Global markets' meltdown. The gloom and doom camp makes a persuasive case. Nouriel Roubini, a professor at New York University, had been warning for years of the dangers of an international financial implo-sion and the current economic crisis proved him depressingly right. In a recent article, Roubini has laid out a bleak scenario for China. The risk of a hard landing in China is sharply rising, he writes,\" A deceleration in the Chinese growth rate ...is highly likely, and an even worse outcome cannot be ruled out.\" But a clique of China specialists inside the country predicts a different outcome. They believe that a range of factors unique to China will not only preserve it from the worst of the global meltdown but also keep its economy chugging along at about 8% GDP growth in 2009. So who's right ? I'd go with the locally based economists. While the U.S. fiscal package is unlikely to add even 1 percentage point to American growth, a recent report by Merrill Lynch estimates that the $600 billion stimulus Beijing unveiled in mid-November will likely add 3 percentage points. And that was before China's provinces unveiled their own $1.4 trillion bailout plan, which depends on a massive infrastructure-building spree to boost the economy. Such growth would be unachievable in other economies.",

            "\tVirtual currencies are growing in popularity. While the collective value of virtual currencies is still a fraction of the total U.S. Dollars in circulation, the use of virtual currencies as a payment mechanism of transfer of value is gaining momentum. Additionally, the number of entities (issuers, exchangers and intermediaries, to name just a few) that engage in virtual currency transactions is increasing and these entities often need access to traditional banking services. Virtual currencies are digital representations of value that function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value (buy now redeem later policy). In many cases, virtual currencies are \"convertible\" currencies; they are not legal lenders, but they have an equivalent value in real currency. Despite what seems to be a tremendous interest in virtual currencies, their overall value is still extremely small relative to other payment mechanisms, such as cash, cheques and credit and debit cards. The virtual currency landscape includes many participants from the merchant that accepts the virtual currency, to the intermediary that exchanges the virtual currency on behalf of the merchant, to the exchange that actually converts the virtual currency to the real currency to the electronic wallet provider that holds the virtual currency on behalf of its owner. Accordingly, opportunities abound for community banks to provide services to entities engaged in virtual currency activities. Eventually, it is also possible that community banks may find themselves holding virtual currency on their own balance sheets. \n\tLaunched in 2009, Silicon is currently the largest and most popular virtual currency. However, many other virtual currencies have emerged over the past few years, such as Litecoin, Dogecoin, Peercoin and these provide even more anonymity to its users than that provided by Bitcoin. \n\tAs the virtual currency landscape is fraught with dangers, what important risks should community bankers consider ?",
            "\tOur civilization has evolved from the horrors of Newgate, where people were strung up for even picking pockets. In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany and Costa Rica became the first countries to ban the death penalty in their Constitution. Most democratic countries have done away with this punishment; others still have it existing in the law but do not entertain the option. Capital punishment is used widely in Asia for drug-related and war crimes. In 1956, the Indian government sought the opinion of the States on the ' death penalty', and they voted in favour of retaining it. Later, in 1967, the Law Commission also recommended its retention with a paramount view to maintaining law and order. \n\tThe never-ending debate - between the abolitionists and retentionists - on the efficacy of capital punishment as a deterrent has not been resolved. History supports the failure of deterrence, as statistics show no apparent reduction in the crime rate. Prima facie, the penalty of death is likely to have a strong effect as a deterrent on normal human beings; but this concept is not consistent with all offenders, on some of whom it may have limited or negligible effect. Deterrence is subjective to the offender's mentality. To us, he was a criminal; to aspiring terror novices, he is an idol they will now try and emulate. \n\tThe death penalty is claimed by some to be a violation of human rights, primarily of Articles 3 and 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Many philosophers, social reformers, and spiritual leaders have termed this heretic act barbarous, inhuman and degrading. Ironically, this inhuman punishment still exists in the land of the Buddha and Gandhi. The man who opined that the punishment was a negation of ahimsa or non-violence, would have been distraught to see his assassin hanged. His disciple, Jayaprakash Narayan, said: \"The punishment of crime should be aimed at reformation of the criminal and not his extermination.\" \n\tImagine!

            "\tWe have witnessed several disaster in recent times, some natural, others man made. The frequency of such calamities has injured us and deadened our collective sensitivity but that does not reduce the enormity of the personal tragedy of each victim's family and community. The economic loss secondary to the human suffering, but is also substantial. The government whether state or central has standardized its response. This consists of reacting late, blaming others, visits by VIPs. announcing a relief package including compensation for those affected and then forgetting all about it. There seems to be little attempt at drawing lessons from each disaster, storing the knowledge for future use, long term planning for possible pre-emptive action. Preparedness for disasters thus falls short of what is possible using today's technologies. \n\tFloods in many parts of India like the states of Bihar and Assam are a yearly phenomenon. Yet the government seems to be caught by surprise year after year. It is obvious that tarpaulins vaccines, medicines, clothes, satellite phones, large numbers of doctors and paramedical staff etc. will be needed as will boats and buses for evacuation. This is known to all those who have combated emergencies yet the non-availability of these essential services and commodities occurs. Worse the organizational structure and mechanisms for dealing with disasters are lethargic and ill defined.

It could have aggregated and disseminated experiences and knowledge, stocked many of the essential items required in an emergency or worked with agencies to ensure sufficient stocks, but hasn't. \n\tWhile the reaction to major disasters is dismal, the response to emergencies like accident is equally sad.

Now Tokyo alone has some 16,000 coffeehouses; the nation, more than 100,000. \n\tJapan's yen for coffee requires plenty of yen these days the equivalent of $1.50 a serving. For those who find indoor prices too steep, platoons of curb side vending machines dispense coffee for about 50 cents a can, hot or cold according to the season. \n\tFrom humble beginnings as both food and drink for African tribesmen, coffee evolved into a global phenomenon of extravagant proportions. Among natural commodities in international trade, coffee usually ranks second only to petroleum in dollar value, accounting for 12 billion in 1979. All 50 exporting countriesled by Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and the Ivory Coast rely on coffee as a major source of foreign exchange. Some 25 million people depend on it for their livelihood and uncounted millions down it by the pot-full. This adds up to an amazing piece of action for a peanut-size bean whose sole purpose on this planet is to provide a virtually nutrition-less beverage made mildly stimulating by the caffeine it contains 75 to 155 milligrams per cup. \n\tUnlike Brazil, which grows a third of the world's supply some five million tons last year and drinks a third of what it raises, most producing nations consume coffee sparingly. The bean brings more leaving home than staying there. \n\tIt's not their addiction to caffeine doses heavily sweetened and darkly brewed that gives Brazilians the jitters. Rather, it's the chilling thought of a killing frost, which, in 1975, damaged nearly half of the country's three billion coffee-trees and sent retail prices into orbit. \n\tAnother such disaster loomed in June 1979. Frost had again hit southern Brazil. The loss of a single tree means the loss of income on that spot for the three to five years it takes to replace it.

We strap ourselves in a flying tin can with two hundred other people not because we know the pilot but because we believe that airline travel is safe.

We expect that the people who run these institutions know what they are doing, that they build and operate machines that work as they are supposed to and that they are looking out for our welfare even though we are strangers. \n\tWhen one of these factors is weak or absent, trust breaks down and we either pay a high price in safety as in the Bhopal tragedy or a large 'welfare premium' such as the elaborate security measures at airports. Trust deficient environments work in the favour of the rich and powerful, who can command premium treatment and afford welfare premiums.

            "\tGoldman Sachs predicted that crude oil price would hit $200 and just as it appeared that alternative renewable energy had a chance of becoming an economically viable option, the international price of oil fell by over 70%. After hitting the all time high of $147 a barrel, a month ago, crude fell to less than $40 a barrel. What explains this sharp decline in the international price of oil? There has not been any major new discovery of a hitherto unknown source of oil or gas. The short answer is that the demand does not have to fall by a very sizeable quantity for the price of crude to respond as it did. In the short run, the price elasticity of demand for crude oil is very low. Conversely, in the short run, even a relatively big change in the price of oil does not immediately lower consumption. It takes months, or years, of high oil price to inculcate habits of energy conservation. World crude oil price had remained at over $60 a barrel for most of 2013-2014 without making any major dent in demand. \n\tThe long answer is more complex. The economic slowdown in the US, Europe and Asia along with dollar depreciation and commodity speculation have all had some role in the downward descent in the international price of oil. In recent years, the supply of oil has been rising but not enough to catch up with the rising demand, resulting in an almost vertical escalation in its price. The number of crude oil futures and options contracts have also increased manifold, which has led to significant speculation in the oil market. In comparison, the role of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in fixing crude price has considerably weakened. OPEC is often accused of operating as a cartel restricting output, +of crude during the 1970s and the first half of the 80s. But, with increased futures trading and contracts, the control of crude pricing has moved from OPEC to banks and markests that deal with futures trading and contracts. OPEC has, in fact, announced its decision to curtail output.",

At the right hand of the king, she was known to sit and aid him in all his judicial probes. You could not escape her deep-set eyes, when you commit a crime as she always know the victim and the culprit. Her generosity preceded her reputation in the kingdom and her hands were always full to give. People in the kingdom revered her because if she passed by, she always gave to the compassionate and poor. \n\tFar away from the kingly palace lived a man named Raman with no ends to his poverty and no means to rectify it. Raman was wrecked with poverty as he had lost all his land to the landlord. His age enabled him little towards manual labour and so begging was the only alternative to salvage his wife and children.

For those who find indoor prices too steep, platoons of curb side vending machines dispense coffee for about 50 cents a can, hot or cold according to the season. \n\tFrom humble beginnings as both food and drink for African tribesmen, coffee evolved into a global phenomenon of extravagant proportions. Among natural commodities in international trade, coffee usually ranks second only to petroleum in dollar value, accounting for 12 billion in 1979. All 50 exporting countriesled by Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and the Ivory Coast rely on coffee as a major source of foreign exchange. Some 25 million people depend on it for their livelihood and uncounted millions down it by the pot-full. This adds up to an amazing piece of action for a peanut-size bean whose sole purpose on this planet is to provide a virtually nutrition-less beverage made mildly stimulating by the caffeine it contains 75 to 155 milligrams per cup. \n\tUnlike Brazil, which grows a third of the world's supply some five million tons last year and drinks a third of what it raises, most producing nations consume coffee sparingly. The bean brings more leaving home than staying there. \n\tIt's not their addiction to caffeine doses heavily sweetened and darkly brewed that gives Brazilians the jitters. Rather, it's the chilling thought of a killing frost, which, in 1975, damaged nearly half of the country's three billion coffee-trees and sent retail prices into orbit. \n\tAnother such disaster loomed in June 1979. Frost had again hit southern Brazil. The loss of a single tree means the loss of income on that spot for the three to five years it takes to replace it. Multiply that by the 15 million trees, and you can appreciate the concern.",

Today is an age of exponential change. New and ever improving technologies are popping up every day and in every corner of society. Educating the best and the brightest in this brave new world will take a new and improved educational paradigm. Allowing our educational tools to age in the corner of the classroom will be the mistake that may cost us our future. Throwing away masses of children to inequitable access will ensure that we languish at the bottom of the global pool of employable workers for decades to come. \n\tTechnology will shape the way we educate students in the next decade. A user is not simply a person who uses. For the student, being a user should involve using the latest technology in a free and autonomous manner. This newfound freedom will allow the student to become an active participant in his/her education instead of a passive passenger. In our current technological society, being a user also means being tracked. Tracking a student means having the ability to target education towards weaknesses and strengths. The ability to accurately customize curricula to the individual has been the holy grail of educational philosophy for many years. This golden age of technological development may soon enable this dream to become a reality. Current educational curricula and individual assessment is arbitrary at best. Accurately assessing a student can only be achieved by using modern tracking and database technologies. Imagine a world where every child has a tablet computer with ready access to the internet. Further, imagine that every student can access all the knowledge of humankind freely at any moment in time. Continue to imagine a world where a misspelled word brings up a spelling challenge application instead of an auto correction. Try to contemplate what it would mean for a teacher to have a database of every misspelled word.",
            "\tGoldman Sachs predicted that crude oil price would hit $200 and just as it appeared that alternative renewable energy had a chance of becoming an economically viable option, the international price of oil fell by over 70%. After hitting the all time high of $147 a barrel, a month ago, crude fell to less than $40 a barrel. What explains this sharp decline in the international price of oil? There has not been any major new discovery of a hitherto unknown source of oil or gas. The short answer is that the demand does not have to fall by a very sizeable quantity for the price of crude to respond as it did. In the short run, the price elasticity of demand for crude oil is very low. Conversely, in the short run, even a relatively big change in the price of oil does not immediately lower consumption. It takes months, or years, of high oil price to inculcate habits of energy conservation. World crude oil price had remained at over $60 a barrel for most of 2013-2014 without making any major dent in demand. \n\tThe long answer is more complex. The economic slowdown in the US, Europe and Asia along with dollar depreciation and commodity speculation have all had some role in the downward descent in the international price of oil. In recent years, the supply of oil has been rising but not enough to catch up with the rising demand, resulting in an almost vertical escalation in its price. The number of crude oil futures and options contracts have also increased manifold, which has led to significant speculation in the oil market. In comparison, the role of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in fixing crude price has considerably weakened. OPEC is often accused of operating as a cartel restricting output, thus keeping prices artificially high. it did succeed in setting the price of crude during the 1970s and the first half of the 80s. But, with increased futures trading and contracts, the control of crude pricing has moved from OPEC to banks and markets that deal with futures trading and contracts.",

The rays of the Sun were put to shame with the iridescent light that Matsya illuminated, with her beauty and brain. At the right hand of the king, she was known to sit and aid him in all his judicial probes. You could not escape her deep-set eyes, when you commit a crime as she always know the victim and the culprit. Her generosity preceded her reputation in the kingdom and her hands were always full to give. People in the kingdom revered her because if she passed by, she always gave to the compassionate and poor. \n\tFar away from the kingly palace lived a man named Raman with no ends to his poverty and no means to rectify it. Raman was wrecked with poverty as he had lost all his land to the landlord. His age enabled him little towards manual labour and so begging was the only alternative to salvage his wife and children. Every morning, he went door to door for some work, food or money. The kindness of people always got him enough to take home. But Raman was a little self-centered. His World began with him first, followed by his family and the rest. So, he would eat and drink to his delight and return home with whatever he found excess. This routine followed and he never let anyone discover his interests as he always put on a long face, when he reached home. \n\tOne day as he was relishing the bowl of rice he had just received from a humble home, he heard that Rani Matsya was to pass from the very place he was standing. Her generosity had reached his ears and he knew if he pulled a long face and showed how poor he was, she would hand him a bag full of gold coins - enough for the rest of his life, enough to buy food and supplies for his family.

            "\tTo some extent, it is the nature of the intellect to narrow our vision and give it focus. Tragedy comes in when we forget this limitation and think that the intellect can comprehend things as a whole. The intellect views the world through a slit. When a cat walks by, it observes the eye, then fur, and then the tail, and then it infers that the eye is the cause of the tail, unless of course, the cat was walking backward. If this sounds absurd, some of the theories about biochemistry and behavior use very similar reasoning. Nachiketa would object, 'Man, why don't you open the door? That's just your black cat Frodo, pacing back and forth'. But instead we usually get caught up in clarifying slit-information, even though without a larger view our conclusions may be entirely wrong. To make matters words, we specialize. I am not against specialization per se but what often happens is that we do not even look through whole slit; we subdivide. My field is the upper part of the tail; yours is the lower. I might even forget about the eye and the fur. My main concern will be my debate with a colleague in Tokyo over whether hair on the tail grows up or down. If anybody asks how the eyes fits in, I refer him to another researcher. After all, what have eyes got to do with geotropic hair growth? \n\tDebates like this cannot be resolved on the slit level. What is required is to open the door; then argument becomes unnecessary. Once the door is opened, even a little, we will not quarrel over whose slit is correct or whether we should confine ourselves to the top of it or the bottom. As long as we see only part of the picture, logic and argumentation can never settle an issue. When the intellect becomes calm and clear, theory gives way to demonstration. It is not beyond our reach to see life whole. We have simply become so attached to this precious slit that we think there is no higher mode of knowing. After a while, we become so used to slits that we put on a special mask with just a hairline crack in front of the eyes.",

It is found that when there is peace, science is constructive, when there is war, science is perverted to destructive ends. The weapons which science gives us don't necessarily create war, these make war increasingly more terrible. Until now it has brought us to the doorstep to doom. Our main problem, therefore, is not to curb science, but to stop war. This is a job in which everybody must participate, including the scientists. But the bomb of Hiroshima suddenly woke us to the fact that we have very little time. The hour is late and our work has scarcely begun. Now we are face to face with this urgent question: \"Can education and tolerance, understanding and creative intelligence run fast enough to keep us abreast with our own mounting capacity to destroy?\"That is the question which we will have to answer in one way or the other .

He hated the eye-for-an-eye method like Gandhi ji and fought with the weapon of non-violence-a weapon, said King, that 'cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it. It is a sword that heals'. And he raised a vast army. It was an army that would move but not maul. It was an army to storm bastions of hatred, to lay siege to the fortress of segregation, to surround symbols of discrimination.

The shock and pain adding to his fury, Kunta lunged upward, his head bumping hard against wood - right on the spot where he had been clubbed by the \"toubol\" back in the woods.

Quite unwittingly we have increased the enrolment in schools alarmingly. Most of the students have neither the requisite aptitude nor any clear-cut goal in life. The destiny of students would be decided in the final examination of a written nature to test bookish, rote memory.

None would venture to seek entry into such centres of excellence unless one has proven aptitude to profit from training. Here the students have excellent rapport with their teachers who evaluate their performance on a day-to-day basis and provide constant feedback.

The survey found that over 73 per cent of all households in the highest income categories (SEC A & B) drink tap water without boiling it and as many as 55 per cent of the same group drink tap water after filtration through a cloth, but without boiling. \n\tThough every school child knows that unboiled tap water contains unseen disease causing germs, and is unsafe to drink, the high level of indifference to boiling water will come as a surprise to many.

They blocked out or distorted other features of the western renaissance (revival) which promised so much for humanity. What people have been and are still being taught to praise are money, success, control over the lives of others, acquisition of more and more objects. Modern social, political, and economic systems, whether capitalist, fascist or communist, reject in their working the basic principle that the free and creative enfoldment of every man, woman and child is the true measure of the worth of any society. Such enfoldment requires understanding and imagination, integrity and compassion, co-operation among people and harmony between the human species and the rest of nature. Acquisitiveness and the pursuit of power have made the modern man an aggressor against everything that is non- human, an exploiter and oppressor of those who are poor, meek and unorganized, a pathological type which hates and distrusts the world and suffers from both acute loneliness and false pride. \n\tFor months the old tanker, African Queen, lay turned over on her side, stuck fast in the sand off the coast of Maryland.

            "\tOur theory and practice in the area of sentencing have undergone a gradual but dramatic metamorphosis through the years.

The judge's prime objective is not to punish but to treat. \n\tThis emphasis on treatment of the individual has created a host of new problems. In seeking to arrive at the best treatment for individual prisoners, judges must weigh an imposing array of factors. I believe that the primary aim of every sentence is the prevention of future crime. Little can be done to correct past damage and a sentence will achieve its objective to the extent that it upholds general respect for the law. discourages those tempted to commit similar crimes, and leads to the rehabilitation of the offender, so that he will not run afoul of the law again. Where the offender is so hardened that rehabilitation is plainly impossible the sentence may be designed to segregate the offender from society so that he will be unable to do any future harm. The balancing of these interacting and often mutually antagonistic factors requires more than a good heart and a sense of fair play on the judge's part although these are certainly prerequisites. It requires the judge to know as much as he can about the prisoner before him. He should know the probable effects of sentences upon those who might commit similar crimes.",

            "\tThe task which Gandhi ji undertook was not only the achievement of political freedom but also the establishment of a social order based on truth and non-violence, unity and peace, equality and universal brotherhood, and maximum freedom for all. This unfinished part of his experiment was perhaps even more difficult to achieve than the achievement of political freedom. Political struggle involved fight against a foreign power and all one could do was either join it or wish it success and give it his moral support. In establishing the social order of this pattern, there was a lively possibility of a conflict arising between groups and classes, of our own people. Experience shows that man values his possessions even more than his life because in the former he sees the means for perpetuation and survival of his descendants even after his body is reduced to ashes. A new order cannot be established without radically changing the mind and attitude of men towards property and, at some stage or the other, the 'haves' have to yield place to the 'have-nots'. We have seen, in our time, attempts to achieve a kind of egalitarian society and the picture of it after it was achieved. But this was done, by and large, through the use of physical force. \n\tIn the ultimate analysis, it is difficult, if not impossible, to say that the instinct to possess has been rooted out or that it will not reappear in an even worse form under a different guise. It may even, be that, like a gas kept confined within containers under great pressure, or water held by a big dam, once a barrier breaks, the reaction will one day sweep back with a violence equal in extent and intensity to what was used to establish and maintain the outward egalitarian form. This enforced egalitarianism contains, in its bosom, the seed of its own destruction. \n\tThe root cause of class conflict is possessiveness or the acquisitive instinct. So as long as the ideal that is to be achieved is one of securing the maximum material satisfaction.",

            "\tIn looking at Air India in the 21st century, I believe that the airline has an intrinsic advantage over its competitors. It being the national carrier of one of the largest markets in the world and the fact that it holds merely 25 percent of the present market share in and out of India provides it with a unique opportunity of increasing it to atleast 50 percents by the turn of the century. I believe that Air India has an inherent advantage in achieving this goal as it represents a nation which is traditionally known for its hospitality and culture which give it a cutting edge in the service industry. \n\tAll of us who are familiar with the technological excellence of the west, are also distinctly conscious of the lack of a service culture to support the same. Natural courtesy and friendliness must however, be polished with professionalism and I believe that this attribute will contribute to the excellence of Air India in the future and provide it with the competitive edge it requires. Air lines which are deemed 'great' in our part of the world today base their product advantage on this attribute. I see a revival of a style which was created for aviation industry by Air India.

The ugly girl gutted fish for a living, so her hands smelt funny and her dress was covered in scales. She had no mother or brother, no father, sister, or any friends. She lived in a ramshackle house on the outskirts of the village, and she never complained. \n\tOne by one, the village girls married the local lads, and up the path to the church they'd prance, smiling all the way. At the weddings, the ugly girl always stood at the back of the church, smelling slightly of brine. The village women gossiped about the ugly girl. They wondered what she did with the money she earned. The ugly girl never bought a new frock, never made repairs to the house, and never drank in the village tavern. Now, it so happened that outside the village, in a great damp swamp, lived an old basket-maker who was famed for the quality of his work. One day the old basket-maker heard a knock on his door. When he opened it, the ugly girl stood there. In her hand, she held six gold coins. 'I want you to make me a husband,' she said. 'Come back in a month,' he replied. Well, the old basket-maker was greatly moved that the ugly girl had entrusted him with such an important task. He resolved to make her the best husband he could. He made the wicker husband broad of shoulder and long of leg, and all the other things women like. He made him strong of arm and elegant of neck, and his brows were wide and well-spaced. His hair was a fine dark brown, his eyes a greenish hazel. When the day came, the ugly girl knocked on the basket-maker's door. 'He says today is too soon. He will be in the church tomorrow, at ten,' said the basket-maker. The ugly girl went away, and spent the day scraping scales from her dress. \n\tLater that night, there was a knock on the door of the village tailor. When the tailor opened it, the wicker husband stood outside. 'Lend me a suit,' he said about it.",

To the Pilots of India's ship of destiny his advice was, 'Fear not the waves of the sea, but mind the leaks in our own vessel. If we became a subject-people, it was not because the British were wicked but because we were weaklings. We had ceased to believe in ourselves. Instead of tapping the sources of our own power, we were content to pick rags from other peoples dust-bins. Unlike Gandhi, Tagore believed in the power and resources of science, though he dreaded the prospect of man becoming the slave of machines instead of machines being the slaves of man. In fact, he dreaded every form of organized power, whether social, political or industrial, which ignored human values and tended to stifle the personality of man. \n\tThough outside India Tagore upheld and interpreted the Indian philosophy of life, in his own country he was the severest critic of its social institutions and religious practices which encouraged superstition and inequality and tolerated injustice. \n\tKitchen garden today is driven by both aesthetics and necessity.

Even if one didn't know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred, one could deduce it from general principles. \n\tNearly all the sports practiced nowadays are competitive. You play to win, and the game has little meaning unless you do your utmost to win. In the village where you pick up sides and no feeling of local patriotism is involved, it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise, but as soon as the question of prestige arises, as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be disgraced if you lose, the most savage combative instincts are aroused. Anyone who has played even in a school football match knows this. At the international level sport is frankly mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously believe - at any rate for short periods - that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue. \n\tThe important thing in life is not what you have been but what you are reaching for and becoming. At my age, when I can see the end of the road more clearly than most, I can sit back and recollect in tranquility the varying vicissitudes of my life and what it has taught me. When I look back, I find that the great and glorious hours of my life were those when I gave a helping hand to others without expecting anything in return and not when I struggled and succeeded to gain my own ends. And I can well imagine and appreciate that in this world those alone live who live for others. I have no regrets for the past. Life has been kind to me.",
            "\tA morning commute seems like a good time to embark on an ambitious train of thought. At least, that was the idea from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which put a professor on a train on Wednesday to lecture commuters. Passengers on the 9 am train from the suburban community of Modvin to Tel Aviv put away their morning tabloids and iPods to listen to a talk from professor Hanoch Gutfreund on 'Einstein's love letters'. The lecture was the first of the university's 'Scientists on the Rails' programme: an attempt to broaden the appeal of higher education and bring academia to the people. \n\tUnsure how the move would be received, the train talks have been rescheduled for just after morning rush-hour and only in one carriage on the train to avoid antagonizing people. As the train chugged through tunnels and past the airport, one woman interrupted the professor with a question. \"Will you finish your talk before we reach the station ?\" she wanted to know. \n\t\"Madam, by the time you reach your station, you'll have our BA\", came the reply from the professor. \n\tThe two dominant features of our age are the science and democracy.

Otherwise our religious beliefs will be reduced to wishful thinking. Modern man must learn to live with a religion which commends itself to his intellectual conscience, to the spirit of science. Besides, religion should be the sustaining faith of democracy which insists on the intellectual and spiritual development of every human being irrespective of his caste, creed, community or race. Any religion which divides man from man or supports privileges, exploitation, wars cannot commend itself to us today.

But \"a permanent decline in global oil production is virtually certain to begin within 20 years\". Hatfield believes, \"Serious planning is needed to deal with the economic consequences.\" Hatfield's comments, which appeared in an article in the latest issue of the weekly science journal Nature are likely to provoke controversy. The oil industry, while acknowledging that oil reserves are finite, says Hatfield's comments are too alarmist. Mr. Julian Chisholm, a spokesman for the World Energy Council in London, a consortium of the world's leading energy suppliers, says the oil industry is bullish. The general view of the industry and of energy experts is that there is plenty of oil, and real concern about the level of reserves, at least until 2050 in not beyond. \n\tEvery profession or trade, every art and every science has its technical vocabulary, the function of which is partly to designate things or processes which have no names in ordinary English and partly to secure greater exactness in nomenclature.

            "\tIn modern time, Abraham Lincoln stands as the model of a compassionate statesman. He showed this quality not only in striving for the emancipation of the American blacks but in the dignity with which he conducted the American Civil War. Lincoln did not fancy himself as a liberator. He thought it would be better for all if emancipation was a gradual process spread over many years. He proposed compensation for slave-owners in US, grants for the rehabilitation of blacks freed from 'colonisation' as they called it. But fate was to deem otherwise. The haste with which the South wanted to break away from the Union with the North, compelled him to move faster than he expected, perhaps more than most men of his time he had thought through the issue of slavery. 'We must free the slaves, he said, 'or be ourselves subdued'. 'Before reading the first draft of the proclamation of emancipation, he told his colleagues. 'In giving freedom to the slaves, we assure freedom to the free'. \n\tOn September 22, 1862 Lincoln set his hand on the Proclamation of Emancipation declaring that on the first day of January 1863, all persons held as slaves within any state 'shall be then, and forever free.' Lincoln's revolution for slavery left him without any moral indignation or passion against the slave-owners. The guilt of the slave-owners, he felt, should be shared by the whole country the North and the South, for it seemed to him that everyone in the nation was an accomplice in perpetuating that system. To have whipped up any hatred against slave-owners would, to him, have been an act of malice. \n\t'I shall do nothing in malice', he wrote, 'what I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing'. As the Civil War was coming to a successful conclusion, a Northerner demanded of Lincoln : 'Mr. President, how are you going to treat the Southerners when the war is over?

            "\tVacations were once the prerogative of the privileged few, even as late as the nineteenth century. Now they are considered the right of all, except for such unfortunate masses as in China, for whom life, except for sleep and brief periods of rest, is uninterrupted toil. They are more necessary now than before because the average life is well rounded and has become increasingly departmentalized. The idea of vacations, as we conceive it must be incomprehensible to primitive peoples. Rest of some kind has of course always been a part of the rhythm of human life, but earlier ages did not find it necessary to organize it in the way that modern man has done. Holidays, feast days, were sufficient. \n\tWith modern man's increasing tensions, with the useless quality of so much of his work, this break in the year's routine became steadily more necessary. Vacations became necessary for the purpose of renewal and repair. \n\tRegularity and routine are of the utmost importance in early childhood, and most of all in the first year of life. With regard to sleep, food, and education, regular habits should be formed from the start. Moreover, familiarity of surroundings is very important mentally. It teaches recognition, it avoids overstraining oneself and it produces a feeling of safety. I have sometimes thought that belief in the uniformity of nature, which is said to be a postulate of science is entirely derived from the wish for safety. We can cope with the expected, but if the laws of nature were suddenly changed, we would perish. The infant, because of its weakness, has a need for reassurance, and it will be happier if everything that happens seems to happen according to invariable laws, so as to be predictable. In later childhood, the love of adventure develops, but in the first year of life everything unusual tends to be alarming. Do not let the child have a sense of fear if you can possible help it. If it is ill, and you are anxious, hide your anxiety very carefully, lest it should pass on to the child.",
            "\tThe interview may be conducted by letter and by telephone, as well as in person. Letter and telephone interviews are less satisfactory.

Careful planning saves not only time but also energy of both parties concerned. The interview is used to obtain facts or subjective data such as individual opinions, attitudes, and preferences.

            "\tA close look at the facts relating to political interference in administration shows that it is not a one-way process. There is often a nexus between power-hungry and corrupt politicians and civil servants with convenient principles. Many civil servants are only too anxious to oblige the politicians, and then cash the obligation when they need some special favour. Such attitude of self-righteousness adopted by the civil service is sometimes only a way of covering their own flaws by blaming others. Every now and then some retired civil servants come out with his memoirs, painting a glorious picture of the heights of administrative efficiency reached during his reign. There is often the suggestion that had there not been so much political interference, things would have been even more fantastic. It is not unusual for the self-styled hero to blame not only interfering politicians but also fellow civil servants who were idiots or crooks, for his failures. This attitude of smug self-satisfaction is, unfortunately, developed during the years of service. Self-preservation rather than service is encouraged by our whole system of rules and procedures. \n\tThe remedy has to be drastic and quickly effective. The over-protection now granted to devil servants must end. Today to remove an erring civil servant is just not possible. And the only thing that the highest authority in the Government, both in the State and at the Centre, can do is to transfer an official from one job to another. The rules for taking disciplinary action are so complicated that, in the end, the defaulting civil servant gets away, and gets his full emoluments even for the period of the disciplinary proceedings, thus making it a paid holiday for him. The result is that the administration has become rule-oriented and not result-oriented. Action is possible against the official who takes some interest in his work, but no action is ever taken against a person who does not deliver the goods. If the country is to adopt a result.",

            "\tIt may be asked, \"In what respect do speeches differ from a pamphlet or magazine article?\" There is an essential difference. Speech has a human element lacking in the written word, because speech is communication between the speaker and his audience face to face. This fact should be ever present to the speaker's mind both when preparing and delivering the speech. People addressed each other by word of mouth long before they wrote. Speech, therefore, is more primitive and human than written matter. Public speaking not only admits but demands characteristics which would be blemishes in compositions intended to be read. The attention of the audience must be held, arguments repeated, and free use made of analogies and illustrations. For this reason good speakers are often bad writers, while good writers are rarely effective speakers. A speech is a transitory, evanescent, episodic production depending for its immediate effect not only upon the matter but upon the delivery which enables the great speaker to sway his hearers. From their point of view personality is the thing that counts for most. In written compositions it stands for little or nothing. The quality of the written word is the only thing that matters. The author may be repulsive but he is invisible. He looks at you only through the printed page. The speaker is judged by what he is or what he appears to be. No man can achieve wide distinction as a speaker unless he can impress an audience face to face. That is the acid test of oratory, high or low. That is how the speaker makes his reputation. \n\tEconomists, ethicists and business experts persuade us that honesty is the best policy, but their evidence is weak.

Katherine was as beautiful as her sister, but she had such an ungovernable temper that she was always known as Katherine the Shrew.

Many wanted to marry Bianca but no one was willing to risk marriage with the bad tempered Katherine. At last Baptista decided on a plan.

            "\tJazz had its beginnings in song. Its roots lie deep in the tradition of Negro folk singing that once flourished throughout the rural Southland of the United States before the Civil War. The Negro, in those days, owned only a few crude musical instruments which he made for himself from boxes, barrels and brooms. His voice was his principal means of musical expression. Songs of work and play, trouble and hope, rose on rich and rhythmic voices everywhere in the South-from peddlers crying their wares to the countryside, from work gangs on the rail roads, farm families gathered at the day's end to sing away their weariness in their unpainted cottages overlooking the cotton fields, from the wayside churches singing with the sounds of Sabbath praise. \n\tThese were the voices which the early Negro musicians imitated and transferred to their horns when they taught themselves to play the discarded band instruments that come into hands at the close of the Civil War in the eighteen sixties. As played by their proud Negro owners, the instruments became extensions of the human voice-\"singing horns\" which opened the way to Jazz. For this reason there has always been a strong, singing quality to Jazz. \n\tPower and possession have been central pursuits of modern civilization for a long time.

But after casually examining them, he kept moving to the next section where readymade goods were being sold and further on to the hosiery section. By then, the salesmen had begun to doubt his intentions, and drew the attention of the manager. The manager asked him what exactly he wanted and he replied that he wanted courteous treatment. He explained that he had come to the same shop in casual dress that morning and drawn little attention. His pride was hurt and he wanted to assert himself. He had come in good dress only to get decent treatment, not for getting any textiles. He left without making any purchase. \n\tThe prisoner awaited his chance. For three solid years he had schemed for this opportunity. Now that escape seemed so near at hand, those three years lost some of their monotony. But he would never forget the lashes, the close confinement, low diet, and worse still the mental strain of those black days. Suddenly the warden did what he had hoped. He stopped to unlock the lower padlock. With a dull thud he slumped forward with keys in his hands. Swiftly the prisoner seized his keys, unlocked the cell and ran into the courtyard. It took him four seconds to reach the rope-ladder secretly placed there by his accomplices, five more to clamber over the wall, and three more to jump into the waiting car to be whisked away to freedom. Even though he was guilty, the prisoner felt he had paid for his crime, for the man he had robbed three years ago was still a millionaire. \n\tNationalism is only a curse when it becomes narrow and fanatical.

Nationalism can lead people into thinking only of themselves, of their own struggles, of their own misery and it is when nationalism impels.",
            "\tIf you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. So we can say that the cloud and the paper inter-are. If we look into this sheet of paper even more deeply, we can see the sunshine in it. If the sunshine is not there, the forest cannot grow. In fact, nothing can grow. Even we cannot grow without sunshine. And so, we know that the sunshine is also in this sheet of paper. The paper and the sunshine inter-are. \n\tAnd if we continue to look, we can see the logger who cut the tree and brought it to the mill to be transformed into paper. And we see the wheat. We know that the logger cannot exist without his daily bread, and therefore the wheat that became his bread is also in this sheet of paper. And the logger's father and mother are in it too. When we look in this way, we see that without all of these things, this sheet of paper cannot exist. Looking even more deeply, we can see we are in it too. This is not difficult to see, because when we look at a sheet of paper, the sheet of paper is part of our perception. Your mind is in here and mine is also. So we can say that everything is in here with this sheet of paper. You cannot point out one thing that is not here - time, space, the earth, the rain, the minerals in the soil, the sunshine, the cloud, the river, the heat. Everything co-exists with this sheet of paper. This is why I think the word inter-be should be in the dictionary. \"To be\" is to inter-be. You cannot just be by yourself alone. You have to inter-be with every other thing. This sheet of paper is, because everything else is. Politicians and generals talk of military strategies and maneuvers but something completely different is needed. Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist."
